# Tic

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

In this game I created a TicTacToe Project where the order of X's and O's is set.

X's will go first then O's

X = Green, O = Orange

When a winner or a tie occurs a UI will pop up with the option to
Exit or Restart the game.

The music was created by a friend of mine Named Jay in our discord server.

The programming and material were all created by me
